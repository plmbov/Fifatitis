### Fifatitis 0.7

#### New version of the app is available [here](https://github.com/plmbov/FifatitisMobile "here").

The app is an inside joke that I used to practice my React skills. :) I play FIFA a lot with my friend and we use the app for choosing teams and keep track of the results.

Technologies used in the project:
- React
- Redux
- Axios
- Firebase
